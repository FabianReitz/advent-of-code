# 🎄 Welcome to my Advent of Code Repository! 🎁

This repository is dedicated to solving the daily challenges of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), where we help Santa save Christmas with mediocre code! 🎅🎁🎄

## 🎄 What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual programming event that runs from December 1st through December 25th. Each day, a new programming puzzle is released for participants to solve using any programming language of their choice. Also check [Awesome Advent of Code](https://github.com/Bogdanp/awesome-advent-of-code) and the [Advent of Code Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/).
